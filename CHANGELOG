	Add Webmin support for displaying graphs.

* Fri Apr 03 14:30:03 SAST 2020
	Minor Theme update and bandwidth "upload" graphed as negative
	to "download".

==================================================================
RELEASE 0.8

* Wed Jul 22 18:40:51 +0000 2015
	Add patch dropping 'defined' from 'defined @array' and 'defined %hash'
	constructs, that are fatal in perl 5.22

	Damyan Ivanov <dmn@debian.org>

* Mon Aug 18 16:13:16 CEST 2003
	The "Factor[target]: value" directive implemented. Suggested by
	Adam Denenberg and others, but I've changed this to modify only numbers
	below graphs, not the graphs itself - it is documented in MRTG
	reference(1) manual page to work this way.

	binmode fix for the PNG file as suggested by Paul Rathbone.

	require 5.005 (it should work there, but not tested!)

	thttpd fix by Akihiro Sagawa.

	strftime() now uses only ANSI C standard format string directives.

* Wed Aug 13 16:08:45 CEST 2003
	Work on noi/noo options based on the implementation by Tobias Gruetzmacher.

* Wed Aug 13 15:46:03 CEST 2003
	The kMG[]: <empty> now implemented. Fix suggested by Tobias Gruetzmacher,
	I've modified this slightly.

* Fri Aug  1 17:19:12 CEST 2003
	The automatic compatibility test for strftime("%-H"), which does not work
	on some platforms (e.g. Solaris). The "%H" format string is used instead
	in that case.

* Sun Mar 23 18:06:48 CET 2003
	Make the version string in "require" portable (5.008 instead of 5.8.0).
	Fix suggested by Haroon Rafique.

* Mon Mar 17 14:48:31 CET 2003
	Fixed the undefined variable error when Options[_] was set.
	Reported by Mark Pelillo, thanks!

==================================================================
RELEASE 0.6

* Fri Mar 14 14:39:16 CET 2003
	Bumped the version number to 0.6.
	Fixed some spelling mistakes in FAQ and TODO.
	More known bugs/mis-features added to TODO.

* Wed Mar 12 17:05:53 CET 2003
	Fixed the hard-coded "5 Minute" legend in the daly graph
		(in fact it should be based on the Interval: setting).
		Thanks to Vincent Aniello for reporting this.
	The Interval: parameter is in minutes, not in seconds
		(as opposed from the Refresh: parameter).
	Requires Perl 5.8.0 because of the sprintf() handling.
	Accepts tabs and other whitespace characters at the beginning of
		line, and before and after the ":" sign in the directive.
	Reworked handling of [^], [_], and [$] - now it uses [_]
		when no [target] is set and all of [^], [_] and [$] is set,
		and [^][target][$] otherwise.
		Bug reported by Alejandro Marco.
	Reworked handling of Options[^], [_], and [$]. When no Options[target]
		is set, all of Options[^], [_], and [$] apply. When Options[target]
		is set, the Options[^], Options[target], and Options[$] apply.
		I've try to verify this against MRTG, but its handling of
		these cases seems to be a bit erratic. Sent a question to the
		mrtg list, we'll se what reply I get.
	Added $imagetype configuration variable so that GIF images can be
		used instead of PNG.

* Wed Oct 30 14:08:46 CET 2002
	Fixed the "%.1lf" format string (does not work on 5.8.0).

* Wed Apr 14 18:51:52 CEST 2002
	Fixed the shallow copy of the [_] default values of the "options" hash.
	Fix by Daniel Drown.

* Wed Apr 10 14:24:06 CEST 2002
	The X axis labels on the -day graph looks similar to the original
	MRTG (i.e., labels every 2 hours instead of every 6th hour).
	Suggested by Glen Gold.

* Mon Feb 25 16:08:18 CET 2002
	Fixed the ugly bug with Refresh handling in leaf subdirectories.

===================================================================
RELEASE 0.5

* Thu Feb 21 19:02:40 CET 2002
	Spelling fixes by Evans O'Shaughnessy.
	Multilple config files now works even with different WorkDirs etc.
	The parameters (such as IconDir or Refresh) for the directory
	is taken from the global configuration directives of the first target
	in the particular sub-tree.
	Bumped the version number to 0.5.

* Thu Feb  7 20:36:57 CET 2002
	Incorrect handling of Suppress[]: d (reported by Luc Ducazu).

* Wed Jan 16 09:16:47 CET 2002
	Moved mis-placed call to http_headers() after the opening of the
		PNG file.
	Added FAQ entry about CGI with PATH_INFO in IIS.
	Added FAQ entry about operating systems compatibility.

* Fri Jan 11 13:48:34 CET 2002
	Changed the non-portable strftime("%s", @t) to timelocal(@t)
		(the timelocal() is in the Time::Local module). This
		non-portability has been reported by Takuya Mori.


===================================================================
RELEASE 0.4

* Wed Jan  9 13:50:29 CET 2002
	Fixed the incorrect behaviour when IconDir is not set. Now it displays
		the icons from the same directory where the script is located.
	Fixed the misplaced lc() in the config dir name (bug reported by
		Peter Banfi).
	Added few bug-hunting tips to the FAQ.
	Reformated the ChangeLog to the more readable/structured form.
	Implemented the double-column directory output. When the directory
		contains both subdirectories and graphs, the directory index
		consists of two sections - subdirs first and then graphs.
	The HTML files contain the RCS id of the script in comment in the
		banner part.
	Bumped the version number to 0.4

* Tue Jan  8 10:03:41 CET 2002
	Older versions of RRDtool do not grok the "-g" switch. Added testing
		the $RRDs::VERSION.

* Mon Jan  7 16:10:39 CET 2002
	Configuration file directives can have values including whitespace
		(thanks to Petr Prazak for discovering this).
	Added checking of the RRD::graph's error code (as suggested by
		Petr Prazak).


===================================================================
RELEASE 0.3

* Fri Jan  4 18:00:39 CET 2002
	Directory mode almost fully implemented.
	Bumped the version number to 0.3

* Wed Jan  2 17:57:31 CET 2002
	The Directory[] directive is now visible in the URL.

* Tue Dec 18 14:06:29 CET 2001
	Implemented the following mrtg.cfg directives:
		Unscaled, WithPeak, XZoom, YZoom
	Fixed the wrong behaviour of XScale, YScale.
	Added $version as the separate variable.
	Fixed the global options so that the graph still starts at y_min=0,
		even if there is no time when the variable is near 0.
	Fixed the [^], [_], and [$] behaviour for multiple configuration files
		(the value should not remain defined from the previous
		cfg. file).
