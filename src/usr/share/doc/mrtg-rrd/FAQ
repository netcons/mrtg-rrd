Q: What is this?
A: The mrtg-rrd.cgi scripts is a replacement for the 14all.cgi script
	distributed in the MRTG contrib directory. It is the script
	which can generate on-the-fly HTML output and graph images
	from the MRTG statistics.

Q: Why not let MRTG to generate the graphs?
A: It is much slower to generate thousands of graphs every 5 minutes instead
	of generating them only when somebody is looking at them. This
	script (mrtg-rrd.cgi) uses the '--lazy' option of RRDtool, so images
	are generated only every 5 minutes even if somebody is looking at
	the statistics more frequently.

Q: Do I need an additional software?
A: You need the MRTG itself, and the RRDtool (see the
	http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/ and
	http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/ directories).

Q: How to use this?
A: Just put the mrtg-rrd.cgi somewhere into your WWW tree, where the CGI
	scripts can be executed (such as /var/www/cgi-bin/ directory),
	and edit the line which says "BEGIN { @config_files = <something>}"
	to reflect all your MRTG config files (yes it can handle multiple
	config files as long as the target names are unique). Make sure
	the ImageDir (or the default WorkDir) is set to a directory writable
	by the HTTP server. You may want to edit the "use lib ..." line as well,
	if your RRDs.pm is not located in the @INC (the default Perl search path).

Q: How to get the actual output?
A: Point your browser to the http://your.server/cgi-bin/mrtg-rrd.cgi/ezwf.html
	(no question marks or ampesands here; just add the slash after the
	CGI name, then your resource name -- ezwf here -- and a ".html"
	extension). 

Q: It does not work. What should I do?
A: The author is willing to help you in his spare time, but you must give
	as much information as you can (error messages, maybe HTML files
	it outputs, etc). Please state clearly what are you doing and when
	and how the mrtg-rrd behaviour starts to differ from what you
	are expecting.

Q: It does not display the MRTG banner images at the bottom of the page.
A: Either put the icons to the same directory as mrtg-rrd.cgi, or try to
	set the IconDir: directive in mrtg.cfg. You have to have the
	PNG versions of the images in that directory (mrtg-rrd currently
	does not use GIFs).

Q: It does not display the graphs, just the HTML files. What should I do?
A: The mrtg-rrd (i.e. the HTTP server under which it runs) need the write
	access to the directory where the graph images are to be created.
	Images are created either in the WorkDir: directory, or in the
	ImageDir: directory, if the ImageDir: is set.
	Set the ImageDir: directive to some separate directory
	(it does not need to be visible inside the WWW tree) and make this
	directory writable either by user or group under which the HTTP server
	runs.

Q: On which systems mrtg-rrd runs?
A: I have developed it and tested under Linux, but it should run under any
	system with Perl and RRDtool, whose HTTP server understands CGI
	with PATH_INFO. It has been reported to run under Solaris and even
	Micros~1 Windows with IIS.

Q: I have problem running it on MS IIS. What should I do?

Q1: It is slow. How can I speed it up?
Q2: I want to use FastCGI/mod_perl/Apache::Registry. I don't want to use CGI.
A:  The mrtg-rrd.cgi is written in a mod_perl friendly way. It can be
	run as a FastCGI, mod_perl or Apache::Registry. The script itself
	tries to precompute everything once (i.e. the parsing of mrtg.cfg)
	and then only perform the actual computations. If you want to run it
	under a different environment than CGI, just create the $q object
	with the path_info() method, and then call a handler($q) subroutine
	(see the bottom of the script for an example).

Q: Can it fully emulate the MRTG behaviour?
A: No, but it understands a very large subset of MRTG directives. See the
	file TODO for the list of unimplemented directives. Everything
	else (described in the MRTG reference.1 manpage) should be
	implemented. You are welcome to contribute any improvements.

Q: Why to develop another 14all.cgi?
A: This script tries to produce its output as much similar to the original
	MRTG output as possible. It also implements (I believe) much bigger
	subset of MRTG configuration directives than 14all.cgi.

Q: Where can I find the newest version?
A: Look at http://www.fi.muni.cz/~kas/mrtg-rrd/ - this is the project home
	page. You can also look at the FTP directory -
	ftp://ftp.linux.cz/pub/linux/people/jan_kasprzak/mrtg-rrd/

Q: Can I modify this script?
A: Yes, it is distributed under the terms of GNU GPL. However, if you fix
	a bug in this script, please consider contributing the fix back
	to the author (use the "diff -u" command for generating patch).

Q: Who is the author?
A: This script was written by Jan "Yenya" Kasprzak <kas@fi.muni.cz>.
